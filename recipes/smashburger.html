        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These incredibly easy smashburgers take just 20 minutes of time total for 4 burgers!
            Smashburgers are basically regular <br> burger patties that have been smooshed very
            thin, and then stacked on top of each other with a slice of cheese inbetween. <br>
            They're very juicy and flavorful because of the perfect sear that they get.
            You can cook these on a grill or on a pan, but I <br> recommend doing it on a 
            grill. Enjoy!</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Place the balls onto the flat-top griddle and smash until 0.25in. thick. Use two spatulas to smash. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
                    <li>Grill for 45 seconds, until the edges are dark rown. Flip over the patties and cover 4 with cheese.</li>
                    <li>Grill for another 15-20 seconds, then stack the un-cheesed ones on top of the cheesed ones. Move to a bun.</li>
